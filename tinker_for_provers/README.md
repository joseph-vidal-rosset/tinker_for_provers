## What it does

G4-mic proves formulas in first-order logic and tells you which logic level is required (minimal, intuitionistic, or classical). It generates LaTeX proofs in three formats:
- G4 sequent calculus
- Tree-style natural deduction
- Fitch-style natural deduction

Proofs can be shared via URL.
